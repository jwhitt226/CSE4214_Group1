# 2. Overall Description
2.1 Productive Perspective

*Bookaholics* is a web application that allows the purchasing and selling of books. It is a new self-contained product that will be developed by using frontend and backend programming. The front-end will allow users to physically interact with the web application, and the backend will allow engineers to store and maintain all-important data regarding the application. Our engineers will utilize the programming languages Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the development of the web application. 

2.2 Product Functions 

- All users will be able to create an account

- All users will have the ability to log in and out of the application 

- Users will be able to search the inventory, but only the admin will be able to manage the inventory 

- Buyers can add, remove, view, and check out cart 

2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

*Bookaholics* is an application that is designed for many user types. The main/ most important users that will interact with the application are buyers, sellers, and admins. Depending on the user type, there will be certain authorizations allowed that other users will not have access to. For instance, admins will have the authority to approve or disapprove sellers within the application, but the other user types will not have this specific ascendancy. On a scale from most important to satisfy to least important, buyers will be considered the most important, as they will be purchasing and utilizing the web application the most. Overall, all the users are important and have specific characteristics, but the buyers are the main users that we would like to please first, then sellers and admins will follow.  

2.4 Operating Environment

The web application will operate on Windows and Mac OS servers, in which it will be able to be accessed through Internet Explorer.  

2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

With the development of *Bookaholics*, there will be a few limitations. The application will only be available in English. This indicates that anyone who does not speak or understand the English language will not be able to interact with the web application. Another limitation for the web application will be accessibility. The development of *Bookaholics* will not be designed in a way that will be accessible for individuals who may have difficulty utilizing technology traditionally. For example, users who are visually impaired or lack fine motor skills. Lastly, depending on the user's environment, internet connectivity may play a substantial role in the usage of Bookaholics.
